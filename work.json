I became obsessed with graph based community/cluster identification for a short while, and came up with a little equation which gives an indication of the strength that the edges in a graph join clusters. The paper was published at the CEC. I  haven't really had time to apply community identification to my PhD work, so am not quite sure if this will even make it into my thesis. It was fun though. I also presented this poster at the NZCSRSC 2012 student conference, held at Otago. The second poster gave an overview of the ways in which I am applying graph theory to the analysis of functional connectivity in fMRI data.",
